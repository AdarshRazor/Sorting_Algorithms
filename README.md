# Sorting Algorithms
 
The sorting algorithm is a method of sorting a list of items. There are no fixed way to sort the list, but there are a few common sorting algorithms that are used in many programming languages.

These are as follows:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Heap Sort
  * Counting Sort
  * Radix Sort

We will learn more about these sorting algorithms one by one.

## Bubble Sort

  * **Name:** Bubble Sort
  * **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
  * **Worst Case:** O(n^2)
  * **Best Case:** O(n)
  * **Space Complexity:** O(1)
